## Description

JuniorWorkers's back-end restfull API can be found at https://github.com/JohnDelta/JuniorWorkersAPI

## About
Junior Workers is a concept project of a professional networking web app platform used by undergraduate/postgraduate students and hirers. The main goal of the platform is to help both students and hirers cover their job search needs. Students can create their personal profiles and upload their CVs. Also, they can search job posts created by hirers. Hirers can search for students based on the position requirements they want to cover and create job posts to let students communicate with them.
